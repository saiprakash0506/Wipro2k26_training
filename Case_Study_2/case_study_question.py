Online Movie Ticket Booking REST API – Development & Testing
Problem Statement
A cinema chain wants to build a RESTful backend service for an Online Movie Ticket Booking System.
The system should allow users to view movies, check show timings, and book tickets.
All APIs must be manually tested and automated.

Objectives
Students should be able to:
Understand REST API architecture
Build REST APIs using Flask
Design CRUD-based endpoints
Test APIs using Postman
Automate API tests using requests & pytest
Apply unit testing and TDD concepts

Functional Requirements
1. REST API Design
Follow REST principles:
Stateless communication
Resource-based URLs
JSON request/response
Proper HTTP status codes

2. API Endpoints to Implement (Flask)
HTTP Verb
Endpoint
Description
GET
/api/movies
Retrieve all movies
GET
/api/movies/
Get movie by ID
POST
/api/movies
Add a new movie
PUT
/api/movies/
Update movie details
DELETE
/api/movies/
Delete a movie
POST
/api/bookings
Book movie tickets


3. Sample Movie Data (JSON)
{
  "id": 101,
  "movie_name": "Interstellar",
  "language": "English",
  "duration": "2h 49m",
  "price": 250
}

Testing Requirements
🔹 Manual API Testing (Postman)
Students must:
Perform GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
Use headers: Content-Type: application/json
Validate:
Status codes (200, 201, 400, 404)
Response payload
Booking failure scenarios

🔹 Automated API Testing (Python)
Use:
requests library
pytest
Test Scenarios:
Fetch all movies
Add a new movie
Book tickets
Validate JSON responses
Assert HTTP status codes

Automation Framework Concepts Applied
Pytest test discovery
Fixtures for setup/teardown
Parameterized tests
Assertions & exception handling
Command-line execution
HTML test reports
