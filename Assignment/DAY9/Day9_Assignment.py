#!Question 1 – Automation Framework Basics & Environment Setup

'''
Design a basic Python automation testing framework.			
			
Requirements:			
			
1. Set up a virtual environment			
			
2. Install required tools and libraries (e.g., pytest or unittest)			
			
3. Create a project structure for an automation framework (tests, utilities, configuration)			
			
4. Explain the role of:			
			
Test runner			
			
Test reports			
			
Configuration files			
			
5. Write a sample test case to validate a simple function.

#! Question 2 – Unit Testing & Test Driven Development (TDD)

'''
	
Implement Test Driven Development (TDD) for a simple calculator module.	
	
Requirements:	
	
1. Write unit test cases first for operations:	
	
	
	
Addition	
	
Subtraction	
	
Multiplication	
	
Division	
	
2. Use a Python unit testing framework (unittest or pytest)	
	
3. Implement the calculator functions to make the tests pass	
	
4. Demonstrate handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero)	
	
5. Explain the TDD cycle: Red → Green → RefUnit testing, Test Driven Development
