#! Question 5 – Command Line Execution, Setup & Teardown (Coding)

#Topics Covered: Command line, Setup & Teardown

''' 
Write a Robot Framework test suite that:

1. Uses Suite Setup and Suite Teardown

2. Uses Test Setup and Test Teardown

3. Executes from the command line using:

Tags

Output directory

4. Generates log.html and report.html

5. Includes at least one tagged test case

What This Suite Contains

✔ Suite Setup
✔ Suite Teardown
✔ Test Setup
✔ Test Teardown
✔ Tagged test cases
✔ Console logs
✔ Assertions

🧠 Execution Flow

When you run:

Suite Setup runs once

Test Setup runs before each test

Test executes

Test Teardown runs after each test

After all tests → Suite Teardown runs

#^ this is execution commands
Execute From Command Line

Open terminal inside folder.

🔹 Run All Tests
robot sample_suite.robot

🔹 Run Only Smoke Tagged Tests
robot --include smoke sample_suite.robot

🔹 Run with Custom Output Directory
robot -d results sample_suite.robot


This will generate:

results/
    log.html
    report.html
    output.xml

🔹 Combine Tags + Output Directory
robot -d results --include smoke sample_suite.robot
